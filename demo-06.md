I provide some high level instructions on how to run this demo.

Estimated Demo Time: X Minutes

This demo makes use of an LFIX light bulb, connected to the internet, and allows the audience to change the color of the light bulb by starring the repository.

- Ask the audience to navigate to https://github.com/mickeygoussetorg/intro-to-github-actions-talk, using either the GitHub mobile app, or a device
- Star the repo
- The demo light should begin changing colors
- Open **demo-06-star-the-repo.yml** and show how code works
- Make sure to point out that the trigger is not a CI/CD trigger
- Kick it off yourself just because you can
